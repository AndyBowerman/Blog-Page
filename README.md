# Gatsby Blog page
A blog page I've built using Gatsby, GraphQL & Contentful which allows users to make blog posts via the user friendly Contentful interface and dynamically creates a new page for each post that can be accessed via the blog page.
# Lessons Learned
This was my first full project using Gatsby & I learnt how using graphql & contentful can create a dynamic page that is useful to end users without coding experience.
Initially I worked with markdown posts & learnt how to generate slugs for each page created and render the post data within the blog template I created. I then adapted the page to render contentful posts.
# Future Improvements
I plan to allow users to include images in their blog posts.
# Deployment
Deployed with Netlify.
